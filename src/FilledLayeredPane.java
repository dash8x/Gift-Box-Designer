 * A panel widget that allows components to be layered on top of one another,

 * 
 * This is only useful when all but the lowest layer is set transparent, as
 * the highest opaque layer will obscure any layers below it.
 * 
 * @NOTE If one wants to move the layers to choose which one is visible, your 
 * better option is to use a JPanel with the CardLayout.
